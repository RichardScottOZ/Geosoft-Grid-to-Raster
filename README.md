# Geosoft-Grid-to-Raster
Convert geosoft grid to an open format for useability

## Tools
- Mira Geoscience Geoscience Analyst
- Geoh5py python package
- Rioxarray : goto tool for high level abstracted raster wrangling

## Issues
Need Geosoft/login access to use the converter
- Free to sign up to get their viewer, but you can't export
- Geosoft has their own python package, so you could do it this way, however it is more complicated
	- Use this is you use their gdbs or other stuff and have it already

# Summary
All of the above is a good example of why government data providers should also provide a version in an open format.
